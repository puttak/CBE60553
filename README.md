# CBE60553 - Advanced Chemical Engineering Thermodynamics

In this class we will take a fundamental approach to thermodynamics. Our goal is for you to understand the underlying concepts well, so that you can apply them to your own problems of interest. We begin with a refresher on the basic mathematical structure of thermodynamics. Weâ€™ll then delve into the immutable microscopic underpinnings of thermodynamics. That microscopic picture is the bridge to understanding the thermodynamic properties of gases, liquids, and mixtures. Lastly, we will explore the thermodynamics of reactions, phase change, and non-equilibrium behavior.
