* van der Waals \ce{CO2} redux
Last homework you worked with the fundamental van der Waals equation:
\begin{equation}
s_\text{vdW}(u,v)=s_{0}+R\ln\left (v-b\right ) +c R \ln \left ( u+a/v \right )
\end{equation}
1. Construct the Helmholtz potential of a van der Waals fluid,
   $a_\text{vdW}(T,v)$.  /Hints:/ First differentiate to find the
   relationship between $u$ and $T$.

2. Recall the example done in class of a piston separating two chambers of volumes 1 and
  \SI{10}{L}, respectively, each containing 1 mole of ideal gas, the whole system held isothermal at
  \SI{273}{K}.  We showed in class that \SI{-2.5}{kJ} of work could be extracted by allowing
  the piston to adjust the volumes to \SI{5}{L} and \SI{6}{L}.  Compare the amount of work available
  from the same process and conditions if the fluid was van der Waals \ce{CO2}.

3. Compare the ideal and van der Waals \ce{CO2} cases if the volumes started at 0.1 and
  \SI{1.0}{L} and ended at 0.5 and \SI{0.6}{L}.

4. Take the same case of a system of total volume of \SI{1.1}{L}, but now put 1 mole of van
  der Waals \ce{CO2} fluid on one side of the piston and 1 mole of ideal gas on the other.  If
  the piston was allowed to freely move, where would it end up?

* Manipulating thermodynamic derivatives
As Prateek might say, the susceptibilities, $c_P$, $\alpha$, and $\kappa_T$, are
  "awesome." Everything about a one component fluid can be expressed in
  terms of them, and for good reason! Here's some practice with them.
1. Express the derivative \(\left ( \frac{\partial T}{\partial v} \right )_h\) in terms
    of the three susceptibilities.

2. Determine the susceptibilities of a van der Waals fluid.

3. Plot \(\left ( \frac{\partial T}{\partial v} \right )_h\)  vs.\nbsp{}\(v\) for \(T\) from \(-50\) to
   \SI{50}{\celsius} in \SI{20}{\celsius} increments for van der Waals \ce{CO2}. Under what
   conditions of temperature and volume is the derivative negative?

* Practice with potentials
While a Carnot refrigerator sure would be efficient, in practice we don't
  like to wait an eternity for our 'fridges to get cold.  Practical refrigerators use the
  Joule-Thomson effect and irreversible, isenthalpic expansion to create the cold we
  love.  Let's see how cold we can make things with van der Waals \ce{CO2}.

1. Construct the enthalpy $h_\text{vdW}(T,v)$ of a van der Waals fluid.

2. Determine the change in temperature when van der Waals \ce{CO2} is isenthalpically
    expanded from $10^{-4}$ to $10^{-3}~\text{m}^3~\text{mol}^{-1}$, starting from \SI{10}{\celsius}.

3. A more reliable estimate of the change in temperature can be gotten from thermodynamic properties charts.  Thermodynamic charts for \ce{CO2} refrigerant are available at [[https://i0.wp.com/emersonclimateconversations.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/co2-post-3-figure-2.jpg?ssl=1][link]].  Use the pressure-enthalpy chart at the end of this document to determine the change in temperature for the same isenthalpic expansion as in the previous question.

* A departure from ideality
The examples above assume the heat capacity of \ce{CO2} to be a constant. More
generally heat capacities are functions of temperature and pressure. (We'll learn why when
we study statistical mechanics.)  It's common to report heat capacities in a hypothetical
ideal gas, pressure-independent limit, $c_{p}^\text{ig}(T)$.  For instance, the molar heat
capacity of ideal \ce{CO2} is reported to be:
  \begin{equation*}
    c_p^\text{ig}(t) = -11.401074 - 55.231532t+5.149108t^2-0.29158t^3+0.110128t^{-2}+115.93493t^{1/2}
  \end{equation*}
where $t=T(K)/1000$.

1. Find the change in molar entropy of "ideal gas" \ce{CO2} when heated from 290 to
   \SI{350}{K}.

2. To find the real change in entropy, we would need to know the difference in entropy
   between the ideal gas and real states of \ce{CO2} at identical $T$ and $v$ conditions.  This
   difference is called a "departure function." To create this, we construct a hypothetical
   path between the real and ideal gas states, first expanding the van der Waals gas
   from $v$ to $v\rightarrow \infty$, where it behaves ideally, and then compressing from $\infty$
   to $v$ as an ideal gas.  Express $\left ( \frac{\partial S}{\partial v}\right )_{T}$ in terms
of susceptibilities.

3. Construct $\left ( \frac{\partial S}{\partial v}\right)_{T}$ for ideal \ce{CO2}.

3. Construct $\left ( \frac{\partial S}{\partial v}\right)_{T}$ for van der Waals
   \ce{CO2}.

4. Construct the departure function $S^{vdW}(T,v) - S^{ig}(T,v)$ by appropriate integration.  /Hint/: This difference is equivalent to /adding/ \(S^{vdW}\) integrated along the path \(v \rightarrow\infty\) and \(S^{ig}\) integrated along the path \(\infty \rightarrow v\).

5. Use the departure function (twice) to compute the molar entropy change when van der Waals
   \ce{CO2} is heated from \SI{290}{K} and \SI{1.0}{L/mol} to \SI{350}{K} and \SI{0.15}{L/mol}.
